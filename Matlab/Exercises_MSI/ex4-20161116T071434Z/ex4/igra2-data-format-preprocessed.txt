Format Description of IGRA 2 Sounding Data Files

---------------------
Notes:
---------------------

1. Both types of files are updated once a day in the early morning Eastern
   Time. The latest observations usually become available within two 
   calendar days of when they were taken.

2. Data files are available for two different time spans:

   In subdirectory data-por, data files contain the full period of record.
   In subdirectory data-y2d, files only contain soundings from the current
     (or current and previous) year. For example, as of August 2016, 
     the files in the data-y2d subdirectory begin with January 1, 2016.

3. Each file in the data-por and data-y2d subdirectories contains the 
   sounding data for one station.
   The name of the file corresponds to a station's IGRA 2 identifier (e.g.,
   "USM00072201-data.txt.zip"  contains the data for the station with the 
   identifier USM00072201).

3. Each sounding consists of one header record and n data 
   records, where n (given in the header record) is the number of levels
   in the sounding.

-------------------------------

These variables have the following definitions:

YEAR 		is the year of the sounding.

MONTH 		is the month of the sounding.

DAY 		is the day of the sounding.

HOUR 		is the nominal or observation hour of the sounding (in UTC on
		the date indicated in the YEAR/MONTH/DAY fields). Possible 
		valid hours are 00 through 23, and 99 = missing. Hours are 
		given as provided by the data provider, and the relationship 
		between this hour and the release time varies by data 
		provider, over time, and among stations.

LVL??TYP1 	is the major level type indicator. It has the following 
		three possible values:

		1 = Standard pressure level (for levels at 1000, 925, 850,
		    700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 
		    20, 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, and 1 hPa)
		2 = Other pressure level
		3 = Non-pressure level

LVL??TYP2 	is the minor level type indicator. It has the following 
		three possible values:

		1 = Surface
		2 = Tropopause
		0 = Other

ETIME		is the elapsed time since launch. The format is MMMSS, where
		MMM represents minutes and SS represents seconds, though
		values are not left-padded with zeros. The following special
		values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.

PRESS 		is the reported pressure (Pa or mb * 100, e.g., 
		100000 = 1000 hPa or 1000 mb). -9999 = missing.

PFLAG 		is the pressure processing flag indicating what level of
		climatology-based quality assurance checks were applied. It
		has three possible values:

		0     = Not checked by any climatology checks. If data value 
		        not equal to -9999, it passed all other applicable 
		        checks.
		1     = Value falls within "tier-1" climatological limits
		        based on all days of the year and all times of day
		        at the station, but not checked by 
		        "tier-2" climatology checks due to 
		        insufficient data. 
		2     = Value passes checks based on both the tier-1
		        climatology and a "tier-2" climatology specific to
		        the time of year and time of day of the data value.

GPH 		is the reported geopotential height (meters above sea level).
		This value is often not available at variable-pressure levels.
		The following special values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.

ZFLAG 		is the  geopotential height processing flag indicating what 
		level of climatology-based quality assurance checks were 
		applied. It has three possible values:

		0     = Not checked by any climatology checks or flag not
		        applicable. If data value not equal to -8888 or -9999, 
		        it passed all other applicable checks.
		1     = Value falls within "tier-1" climatological limits
		        based on all days of the year and all times of day
		        at the station, but not checked by 
		        "tier-2" climatology checks due to insufficient data. 
		2     = Value passes checks based on both the tier-1
		        climatology and a "tier-2" climatology specific to
		        the time of year and time of day of the data value.

TEMP 		is the reported temperature (degrees C to tenths, e.g., 
		11 = 1.1??C). The following special values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.

TFLAG 		is the temperature processing flag indicating what 
		level of climatology-based quality assurance checks were 
		applied. It has three possible values:

		0     = Not checked by any climatology checks or flag not
		        applicable. If data value not equal to -8888 or -9999, 
		        it passed all other applicable checks.
		1     = Value falls within "tier-1" climatological limits
		        based on all days of the year and all times of day
		        at the station, but not checked by "tier-2" 
		        climatology checks due to insufficient data. 
		2     = Value passes checks based on both the tier-1
		        climatology and a "tier-2" climatology specific to
		        the time of year and time of day of the data value.

RH 		is the reported relative humidity (Percent to tenths, e.g., 
		11 = 1.1%). The following special values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.
DPDP 		is the reported dewpoint depression (degrees C to tenths, e.g., 
		11 = 1.1??C). The following special values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.

WDIR 		is the reported wind direction (degrees from north, 
		90 = east). The following special values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.

WSPD 		is the reported wind speed (meters per second to tenths, e.g., 
		11 = 1.1 m/s). The following special values are used:

		-8888 = Value removed by IGRA quality assurance, but valid
		        data remain at the same level.
		-9999 = Value missing prior to quality assurance.
